## Features
- Navigation Bar
  - Featured on all four pages, the fully responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page, Basic Rules of Squash, Gallery and Sign-up page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - The Navigation Bar is designed to have a solid red underscore below the page currently being viewed which allows the user to see at a glance which page is currently being viewed. The underscore was designed to display solid red for symbology purposes in order to replicate the markings on a squash court.
  - The Navigation Bar allows the user easy navigational capabilities across all devices.

- The home page
  - The home page starts with a large image to identify the subject of the webpage. The image has been setup with a zoom function to grab attention add style. The image was specifically chosen as it displays the colours that are prevailant throughout the website.
   - Text overlay on the image states the purpose of the club and advises all welcome to aid inclusivity.

- Club Information Section
  - This section gives overall detail of the club, including history (when it was founded and by who), facility details, information on club teams and future club asperations (to win a trophy).

- Club Details Section
  - Further details are provided in this section relating to the sports facility venue where the squash club matches are to be played. This area is broken down into three sections, horrizontally situated when viewed on a device above 1200 pixels and vertically stacked when viewed on any device under 1200px. Details of the three sections are as follows:-
    - Club Address section: This section contains the address of the Sports Center including contact details and a link to the website. Icons relating to location (in this case pins, commonly used as markers on a map) were selected and positioned on either side of the heading. An image of the facilitys logo is provided with a white background and no border so it blends into the white background seemlessly.
    - Court Price section: This section contains details of the cost of hiring a squash court at Aberdeen Sports Village. Icons relating to price (in this case uneven stacks of coins) were selected and positioned on either side of the heading. Below the heading is text stating the time allocated for the hire which is 45 minutes (the standard time for a squash match). Also detailed are 2 sets of prices for peak times and off-peak times. Peak times are when the sports center is at its busiest, as such this is the more expensive court hire price. Off-peak times are when the sports center is quieter, these hours are more anti-social, as such the court hire is cheaper than at peak times. Of the 3 sections contained within Club Details, this section contained the least amount of text. As such an image was added to visually aid this section. A simple image of a squash ball with a pale background was selected for this purpose. It provides a clean, squash related image that matches well with the selected colour scheme of the website. No image border was added as the pale image background blends nicely with the white colouring of this area.
    - Opening Hours section: This section contains the ASV opening and closing times. Icons relating to time (in this case clock faces) were selected and positioned on either side of the heading. Each day of the week is listed vertically with the facilitys opening and closing times detailed next to each day. Below this is further details as to which hours of the day are classed as peak or off-peak times; this relates to the cost of hiring a squash court as per the court price section above.

- Home Page Bottom Section
    - The Bottom Section consists of two sections which are horizontally positioned when viewed on screen sizes of 1200 pixels and above. When viewed on screen sizes of below 1200px the two sections become vertically stacked. Details of the two sections are as follows:-
      - A large image of the Aberdeen Sports Village is positioned on the left of this section (then at the top when viewed below 1200px). This image displays the ASV on a clear summers day. This image was chosen as I felt it shows the facility looking clean and inviting. I felt it was important to have a large image showcasing the sports center due to the first class facilitys it offers and also to aid locating the venue for new club members.
      - A large google map showing the location of the Aberdeen Sports Village (centered on the map and identified with a pointer) is positioned on the right of this section (then beneath when viewed below 1200px). The map contains the ASV address, a star rating of the facility and a pointer showing exact location.
      - The two sections together (image of ASV and map showing location) provide all the details required to find the venue with ease.

- The Footer
  - The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Squashed. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user and ease of return to the original site.
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media and receive regular updates from the club.

- Basic Rules of Squash
  - This page outlines the basic rules of the game of squash. A full screen image of an exhausted squash player lying on a court was used as a background for this page. The image was selected as it is relevant to the subject of the webpage. I liked that the main image (squash player) only took up a relatively small portion of the right side of the image, leaving a large clear section on the left side showing only empty squash court. This clear area was used as background for overlaying the text detailing the rules. The image was fixed so that it would remain in place whilst scrolling down through the rules, this was acheived by setting the background-attachment to fixed. This page is valuable in that it provides information on how to play which can be used by beginners still learning the sport or by more experianced club members to use as a reference point to resolve any match related disagreements.
